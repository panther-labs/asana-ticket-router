# Testing Environment

Airplane currently doesn't have a way to test tasks that are already being used in production.

Tasks in this folder (and their corresponding tasks on airplane) are used to copy/paste scripts from other tasks for
testing purposes. Feel free to reuse any of these to copy-paste your task's code, then reuse the task in Airplane in
order to test whatever is needed.
